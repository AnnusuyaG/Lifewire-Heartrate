# Lifewire-Heartrate
Intended to be a two device system to help elderly caregivers take care of their loved ones and be anxiety-free. It was specially developed for caregivers of patients suffering from heart conditions.

#### Done as a part of the YLAB Challenge.
##### To be developed further when I get my hands on some more hardware.
